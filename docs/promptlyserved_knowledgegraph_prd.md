### 2.3 How AutoGen Agents Use the Knowledge Graph

#### Agent Query Patterns

1. **Task Discovery**: Agents query for their assigned tasks within active workflows
   ```cypher
   MATCH (t:TASK_TEMPLATE)-[:USED_IN]->(w:WORKFLOW_INSTANCE)
   WHERE t.role = $agent_role AND w.status = 'active'
   RETURN t, w
   ```

2. **Dependency Resolution**: Agents check prerequisites before starting work
   ```cypher
   MATCH (prereq:TASK_TEMPLATE)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(task:TASK_TEMPLATE)
   WHERE task.node_id = $current_task_id
   RETURN prereq
   ```

3. **Cross-Agent Coordination**: Agents notify others upon task completion
   ```cypher
   MATCH (t:TASK_TEMPLATE)-[r:USED_IN]->(w:WORKFLOW_TEMPLATE)
   WHERE t.node_id = $completed_task_id
   RETURN r.notification_trigger, r.visibility_roles
   ```

### 2.4 Customer Instance Architecture

When deployed for a customer, the Knowledge Graph creates:

1. **Shared Template Layer** (Read-Only):
   - All BUSINESS_SEGMENT, WORKFLOW_TEMPLATE, and TASK_TEMPLATE nodes
   - All USED_IN and DEPENDS_ON relationships
   - Shared across all customers as foundational knowledge

2. **Customer Execution Layer** (Read-Write):
   - CUSTOMER nodes with unique customer_id
   - WORKFLOW_INSTANCE nodes (instantiated from templates)
   - TASK_INSTANCE nodes (instantiated from templates)
   - WORK_ARTIFACT nodes (deliverables created by agents)
   - All instance nodes tagged with customer_id for isolation

## 3. Technical Architecture Overview

  source_node_id: string;    // Predecessor task
  target_node_id: string;    // Successor task
  relationship_type: "DEPENDS_ON";
  workflow_context: string;  // Workflow scope
  dependency_type: "Hard" | "Soft";
  priority_score: number;
}
```

## 4. AutoGen Integration Architecture

### 4.1 Agent-Graph Query Patterns

**Task Discovery:**
```cypher
// Find all pending tasks for a role in customer context
MATCH (t:TaskTemplate)-[:USED_IN]->(w:WorkflowInstance)
WHERE w.customer_id = $customer_id 
AND t.role = $agent_role 
AND w.status = 'active'
RETURN t, w
```

**Dependency Resolution:**
```cypher
// Get prerequisites for task execution
MATCH (predecessor:TaskTemplate)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(target:TaskTemplate)
WHERE target.node_id = $task_id
AND predecessor.workflow_context = $workflow_id
RETURN predecessor, relationship
```

**Workflow Orchestration:**
```cypher
// Instantiate workflow with customer context
MATCH (template:WorkflowTemplate {workflow_id: $workflow_id})
CREATE (instance:WorkflowInstance {
  instance_id: $generated_id,
  template_id: $workflow_id,
  customer_id: $customer_id,
  status: 'active',
  created_at: timestamp()
})
RETURN instance
```

### 4.2 Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns

**Sequential Coordination:** Tasks execute in dependency order with explicit handoffs  
**Parallel Coordination:** Independent tasks execute concurrently with synchronization points  
**Adaptive Coordination:** Agents adjust to work maturity rather than rigid sequence constraints  
**Cross-Segment Coordination:** Workflows span multiple business domains with context preservation

### 4.3 Human-Agent Collaboration Framework
