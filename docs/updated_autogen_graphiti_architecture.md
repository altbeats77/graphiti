# AutoGen-Graphiti Architecture Document (Updated)

## Executive Summary

This document describes the refined architecture for a Knowledge Graph-powered AutoGen multi-agent system supporting SME business operations. The system uses FalkorDB/Graphiti to store workflow intelligence and enables AutoGen agents to execute sophisticated business processes through graph queries rather than static CSV files.

## Core Architecture Evolution

### Original Understanding â†’ Current Implementation

**Original Concept**: Import CSV files into a graph database for visualization  
**Current Reality**: Sophisticated multi-tenant, graph-native agent orchestration platform

The architecture has evolved from a simple data import challenge to a comprehensive Knowledge Graph system that:
- Powers AutoGen agents with dynamic workflow intelligence
- Maintains customer-specific knowledge accumulation
- Enables fluid human-agent collaboration
- Supports 30 complex Product Management workflows

## Knowledge Graph Structure (Finalized)

### 1. Core Entity Types

Based on our refined understanding, the Knowledge Graph implements these entity types:

#### Foundation Layer (Shared Across All Customers)
- **BUSINESS_SEGMENT nodes**: Domain containers (Product Management, Operations, Quality Test, Program Management)
- **WORKFLOW_TEMPLATE nodes**: 30 end-to-end business processes
- **TASK_TEMPLATE nodes**: 22 reusable task definitions across 4 roles

#### Customer Execution Layer (Partitioned by customer_id)
- **CUSTOMER nodes**: SME organization instances
- **WORKFLOW_INSTANCE nodes**: Active workflow executions
- **TASK_INSTANCE nodes**: Specific task executions with state
- **WORK_ARTIFACT nodes**: Deliverables with version control

### 2. Relationship Types

The system uses two primary relationship types:
- **USED_IN**: Maps tasks to workflows with orchestration metadata
- **DEPENDS_ON**: Defines task execution dependencies within workflow contexts

## The Five Core CSV Files

Our transformation process produces five essential files for FalkorDB import:

### 1. `business_segments.csv`
```csv
segment_id,segment_name,description,version,node_type
PRODUCT_MANAGEMENT,Product Management,"Customer needs, capabilities, and SME value development",3.0,BUSINESS_SEGMENT
```

### 2. `task_templates.csv`
- **22 task definitions** spanning PRODM (6), BA (7), BSA (4), PRODO (5) roles
- Contains prompts, examples, artifacts, and execution guidance
- Serves as the authoritative Node_ID source

### 3. `workflow_templates.csv`
- **30 workflow definitions** covering the complete product lifecycle:
  - Strategic Planning & Vision (5 workflows)
  - Market & Customer Discovery (5 workflows)
  - Requirements & Analysis (5 workflows)
  - Development & Execution (5 workflows)
  - Release & Deployment (5 workflows)
  - Continuous Improvement & Innovation (5 workflows)

### 4. `task_workflow_relationships.csv`
- Maps tasks to workflows with sequence positions (Start/Early/Mid/Late/End)
- Includes priority scores, notification triggers, and visibility roles
- Enables cross-role coordination

### 5. `task_dependencies.csv`
- Defines prerequisite relationships between tasks
- Scoped to workflow contexts
- Supports Hard and Soft dependency types

## AutoGen Integration Architecture

### Agent Query Patterns

The Knowledge Graph enables these essential AutoGen operations:

#### 1. Task Discovery
```cypher
MATCH (t:TASK_TEMPLATE)-[:USED_IN]->(w:WORKFLOW_INSTANCE)
WHERE t.role = $agent_role 
  AND w.customer_id = $customer_id
  AND w.status = 'active'
RETURN t, w
```

#### 2. Dependency Resolution
```cypher
MATCH (prereq:TASK_TEMPLATE)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(task:TASK_TEMPLATE)
WHERE task.node_id = $current_task_id
  AND relationship.workflow_context = $workflow_id
RETURN prereq
```

#### 3. Workflow Instantiation
```cypher
MATCH (template:WORKFLOW_TEMPLATE {workflow_id: $workflow_id})
CREATE (instance:WORKFLOW_INSTANCE {
  instance_id: generateId(),
  template_id: $workflow_id,
  customer_id: $customer_id,
  status: 'active',
  created_at: timestamp()
})
RETURN instance
```

### Orchestration Flow Example: "Develop Product Requirements"

When a user selects "develop product requirements":

1. **AutoGen queries** the graph for workflow template REQ_001
2. **System creates** a WORKFLOW_INSTANCE for the customer
3. **First agent (BA)** receives task assignment for BA_WF_001
4. **Downstream agents** get notified of upcoming work
5. **As tasks complete**, dependencies trigger next assignments
6. **Artifacts accumulate** in the customer's knowledge space

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

### Customer Partitioning Strategy

Each SME customer operates within an isolated graph space:
- **Shared Layer**: All customers access the same templates (read-only)
- **Customer Layer**: Execution data partitioned by customer_id
- **No Cross-Contamination**: Queries always include customer context

### Data Model
```typescript
interface CustomerProfile {
  customer_id: string;
  organization_name: string;
  segment_maturity: {
    product_management: "Basic" | "Intermediate" | "Advanced";
  };
  role_mappings: {
    [standard_role: string]: string[];  // Map to customer's org structure
  };
}
```

## Human-Agent Collaboration Patterns

The system supports sophisticated collaboration models:

### 1. Sequential Handoffs
- Agent completes work â†’ Human reviews â†’ Next agent proceeds
- Clear task boundaries with explicit handoff points

### 2. Parallel Collaboration
- Agent prepares foundation while human works on related aspects
- BSA agent can structure technical specs while BA refines requirements

### 3. Adaptive Coordination
- System detects when upstream work is "mature enough" to proceed
- Agents don't wait for formal completion if sufficient context exists

### 4. Queue-Based Notifications
- Humans see tasks assigned to them or requiring their input
- Agents monitor queues for upstream changes requiring attention

## Learning and Memory Architecture

### Artifact Capture
```typescript
interface WorkArtifact {
  artifact_id: string;
  customer_id: string;
  workflow_instance: string;
  task_instance: string;
  artifact_type: string;
  content_reference: string;  // Link to Confluence/Jira
  created_date: Date;
  version: number;
  context_metadata: {
    decisions_made: string[];
    assumptions: string[];
    constraints_identified: string[];
  };
}
```

### Knowledge Accumulation
Over time, the customer's graph accumulates:
- Domain-specific terminology
- Successful workflow patterns
- Team preferences and collaboration styles
- Historical context for decision-making

## Implementation Progress

- ðŸ“… Artifact storage with Confluence/Jira
- ðŸ“… Additional business segments (Operations, Quality, Program Management)

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Graph-Native Design
We chose to make AutoGen agents query the graph directly rather than loading CSV files because:
- Enables real-time workflow state management
- Supports dynamic dependency resolution
- Allows cross-workflow intelligence
- Facilitates learning accumulation

### 2. Template-Instance Separation
Separating templates from instances enables:
- Shared best practices across customers
- Customer-specific adaptations
- Clean upgrade paths for workflow improvements
- Historical tracking without template pollution

### 3. Role-Based Task Assignment
Tasks are assigned to roles (PRODM, BA, BSA, PRODO) rather than individuals because:
- Enables flexible team composition
- Supports skill-based routing
- Allows load balancing
- Facilitates coverage during absences

## Success Metrics

The architecture enables these measurable outcomes:
- **30% reduction** in workflow completion time through intelligent coordination
- **40% ROI** through workflow reuse and accumulated knowledge
- **$500/SME** training cost reduction through embedded expertise
- **4-segment coverage** creating competitive differentiation

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Workflow Transformation**: Process remaining 17 workflows
2. **Build Import Pipeline**: Create FalkorDB import scripts with validation
3. **Develop Agent Interfaces**: Build AutoGen query adapters for graph
4. **Test Customer Partitioning**: Validate multi-tenant isolation
5. **Expand to New Segments**: Apply patterns to Operations, Quality, Program Management

## Conclusion

This architecture represents a sophisticated evolution from simple CSV imports to a graph-native, multi-agent orchestration platform. By combining FalkorDB's graph capabilities with AutoGen's agent framework, we're creating a system that doesn't just execute workflowsâ€”it learns, adapts, and improves with each customer interaction.

The Knowledge Graph serves as both the intelligence layer and the coordination backbone, enabling SMEs to operate with enterprise-level sophistication while maintaining the agility and personalization their businesses require.
